# Racecar

Racecar makes it easier to implement multiple tracking vendor libraries on websites.

We all dread it. The client always wants to implement more than one vendor's tracking library on a site. We receive huge excel spreadsheets with hundreds of distinct tags for event/page tracking. Racecar aims to releive some of the pain.
